I earned my PhD in Economics with a focus on Urban and Regional Economics in Jönköping, Sweden in 2014. I completed part of my PhD studies at the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL), University of Illinois.

I started as a Lecturer/Assistant Professor in Real Estate and Spatial Economics at the Land Economy Department in 2018, and promoted to an Associate Professor in 2021. In Cambridge, I am also a Fellow in Economics and Land Economy at Sidney Sussex College. 

After moving to the UK, I remained affiliated to Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN) in Stockholm and Centre for Entrepreneurship and Spatial Economics (CEnSE) in Jönköping.

My research deals with issues related to migration, labour mobility, micro-geography of segregation and ethnic enclaves, retail and service geography, urban amenities, geography of entrepreneurship, as well as political geography.

I am a former recipient of Handelsbanken Wallander postdoctoral scholarship in Sweden (2015), Young Investigator Award in Italy (2018), and the 2019 recipient of the Young Researcher Award in Sweden awarded by the Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum.

I write monthly columns at the newspaper Swedish Daily (Svenska Dagbladet).
